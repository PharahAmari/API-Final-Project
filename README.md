Welcome to our final project for Audio Processing and Indexing course, Leiden University, December 2023. 

**Project description**: 

This project aims to explore the capabilities of Deep Learning in the home security
field by creating a model that behaves like a home security system. Our model intro-
duces a Deep-Learning-driven solution to alarming audio event detection and classifica-
tion in the corresponding alarming audio class. We created a dataset that distinguishes
different alarming sounds to serve this purpose. The interest is focused on making
significant improvements by including audio classes of the most common threatening
sounds observed in a house. The results showed that, despite the high complexity of
the problem, our model is able to achieve an average accuracy of 68.91%
